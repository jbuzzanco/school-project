            The goal of the high school program is to help students find their unique identity in Christ and then to tailor their academic experiences to best accommodate growth in their unique destiny.  Students will be encouraged to identify useful skills in every field of study required in high school and adapt these skills to their vocational interests.  The following is a description of the classes students take each year of high school.
            Every year of high school, students take an offering from each of the categories listed below.  Classes are differentiated so that students may progress at their own rate, but supported so that they do not fall behind.

                  <span>The overall intent of the high school program is to help a student find a holistic sense of wellness, starting first with their relationship with God.  From their personal walk with God, we endeavor to guide them through the process of finding their purpose and connecting with their vocation through their high school studies.  The program further emphasizes academic excellence and brilliance in thought, emotional health, and physical wellbeing.  Emotional health is built through utilizing the Word of God to overcome difficulties and find peace.  Lasting physical wellbeing is built by providing the tools necessary for students to independently understand and implement exercise and nutrition science into their lives based on goals they have set.

                  <span>High school English classes are enriched with instruction from the advanced level of the Orton-Gillingham approach.  The Orton-Gillingham approach, while formulated for treating dyslexia, provides students with a rich understanding of the English language from the roots of the language itself.  Student vocabulary (and accuracy in understanding) continues to increase through the study of Greek combining forms, Latin roots, Anglo-Saxon words, etc.  High school classes will emphasize advanced language structure leading to writing and research skills, as well as literary analysis.  English classes will also periodically incorporate spoken language skills to help students interact with the demands of professional society.

                  <span>High school Math is intended to build a set of logical thinking skills that will not only help them in science class, but be adaptable to their own unique destiny.  Instruction will emphasize deep understanding for each unique learner as much as possible.

                  <span>High school Science will emphasize incorporating the scientific method into their vocations in order to build evaluative skills to help bring their new ideas into reality.  Students may engage in entrepreneurial activities in the elective time, and are taught how to cultivate their creative ideas into possibilities.  Standard science classes will be taught with this end goal in mind.

                  <span>High school History is aimed at understanding the events of history from a Christian worldview, incorporating the Bible's explanation of the nature of humanity and governments.  Advanced levels are taught to seek patterns of events/behavior in history and evaluate them for their origin/motive to gain potential insights into human nature that may be of benefit to them in their calling.  Classes will periodically discuss signs of God's intervention into the events of history.  The ultimate goal is finding an understanding of the way the world works, learning to evaluate the arguments of others and incorporate new ideas based on the student's personal decisions.  Students are taught to make intentional decisions to believe what they believe based on their evaluation of the evidence and the Word of God.  Students are challenged to develop a worldview that will lead to an understanding of current events that will guide them in how they want to interface with them.

                  <span>HPE classes will emphasize discipline, confidence, and respect through martial arts instruction from our resident master and owner of Asian Fighting Arts/Absolute Best Combat.  Students will be challenged physically in new and exciting ways as they discover how to manage their own physical fitness in a safe environment.  These classes will emphasize an understanding of anatomy and physiology as it pertains to physical fitness and exercise science, and will give students the ability to construct their own independent workout regimens that they may practice all throughout their lives.   Through the disciplined structure of the class, students will learn to break through plateaus in their proficiency with exercise that will ignite them on a life-long course of discovery in health and fitness.  Students will also learn self-defense technique and will gain actual rank in the AFA dojo. Students will be coached in nutrition and taught how to create their own basic dietary plans so that they may begin to consider intentional choices in their eating habits.  All HPE instruction is differentiated by design and all students may grow at their own pace.  Each unique learner is afforded the skills to advance, but may do so at their individual rate of growth.

                  <span>The Finding Your Purpose Seminar is aimed at creating a space for discussion about finding the will of God for each individual and learning to follow His leading step by step down whatever vocational path the individual student is called to.  Students are taught to pray based on the Word of God in order to increase their faith to be directed in God's best path for their lives.  They are taught to connect with God's wisdom and guidance for themselves so that as they mature into increasing levels of freedom in adulthood, they have learned to access and consult a wealth of wisdom above what they already have.

The goal is to create a level of independence in learning where the students understand how to best approach new skills/concepts, set goals, and acquire the skills on a deeper level than is typical of young autodidacts.  An entire day of the week is set aside for elective study that will be subject to mandated projects (based on their chosen academic discipline or vocational skill) and other required goals to promote progress in their studies.  The end goal is to help students find a field they really connect with in terms of skill and motivation, and equip them with every skill possible to engage in their field.  Students are encouraged to shape their path as learners of the experts in their field, and also as original thinkers capable of seeing the subject from a fresh perspective if they so choose, and in that way become life-long learners.

            <p class="light">We believe people are created by God with unique skills, and they are meant to contribute these unique skills throughout their lifetime.  We strive to provide a creative learning environment where children may explore their God-given talents and refine them for their individual destiny.  Students will learn to progress into a vibrant adulthood as they acquire the skills they need to live out their most fulfilling purpose.

            <p class="light">Jesus said that Christians are the light of the world.  We believe children should be prepared to be an influence in their communities and vocations.  We believe our children are sent by God into their fields of calling and are meant to bring heaven’s answers to earthly problems.  At TLCA, children learn to become ambassadors of Christ, representing God’s promises and His brilliance in their work.  Leadership at TLCA is developed through creative/entrepreneurial-type perspectives for their career and depth of character from their walk with God.</p>

              We believe that education should be approached with consideration from a holistic standpoint, to include time for other pursuits other than school.  Jon Amos Comenius believed homework is apt to be poorly done, leaving little educational value, but robbing from time that could be better spent with parents and other activities when away from school.
