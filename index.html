            <p class="light">
              We believe that education should be approached with consideration from a holistic standpoint, to include time for other pursuits other than school.  Jon Amos Comenius believed homework is apt to be poorly done, leaving little educational value, but robbing from time that could be better spent with parents and other activities when away from school.

            <h5 class="center">Leadership</h5>

            <p class="light">We believe that leadership is paramount to Christian education.  Students are taught to find their God-given gifts and tap into their unique calling in the kingdom of God.  Class opportunities provide a variety of platforms for creative expression of the individual as they learn to pursue what they were made for.  Students are afforded a space to explore their spiritual, personal, and vocational identity through discipleship and entrepreneurship.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Find-a-Way Day</h5>

            <p class="light">Part of learning to find one’s calling in life will include discussions on pursuing activities that have heavy intrinsic motivations.  Students will be given the opportunity to explore academic disciplines and skills that they feel called to under the guidance of learning coaches.  Students will learn to set goals and acquire skills necessary to identify and obtain the needed skills.

          <h4>If you focus so much on God, how can I be assured that my student gets a good education and is able to perform on state tests or college entrance exams?</h4>
          <p cxlass="left-align light">Our educational philosophy maintains that students will become the greatest learners and thinkers if they learn to cultivate a vibrant relationship with the Lord and walk in the light of His Word.  Student learning should focus on the greatest utility to their lives, and is likely to be best accomplished when the student is prepared to clarify a Godly vision for their futures.  Once a student has adopted a quality relationship with the Lord, they are taught to draw on intrinsic motivations, or inner passions, and will be given opportunities to strive for greater excellence through deep application towards their academic and personal goals.

              <div class="collapsible-body black"><p>At TLCA, students are taught to be enriched spiritually through the Word of God and the move of the Holy Spirit, and they are taught to seek God for supernatural definition of their God-given purpose and vocational calling.  Students who desire to deepen their walk with the Lord will find a place to call home as they grow with other like-minded individuals.

              <div class="collapsible-body black"><p>Every academic and vocational area is assessed in a dynamic way based on the students’ and faculty’s walk with God.  The Bible says we are living stones being prepared for God’s house, and we treat every school year as a unique, God-ordained moment in time that allows for an individualized approach to every student’s development, spiritually, academically, and vocationally.  Much of the activity throughout the school year is adapted to best fit God’s purposes for each student, including specialized electives, and some aspects of core discipline learning.

At TLCA, students are not numbers on paper, but unique children of God who are afforded a lot of individualized attention.  If you are interested in being a part of not just a K-12 school, but in the advancing move of the kingdom of God, this could be the place for you.</p></div>
